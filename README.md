Zenected Threat Defense VPN

Zenected is a cloud based security threat protection service. It’s delivered through a set of pre-configured services. Once a user connects to the Zenected, that user’s network traffic is filtered to keep the bad things out (e.g. phishing sites, malware). The only thing this a user has to configure on the endpoint device (be it a mobile device, a desktop or laptop or IoT device) is a VPN connection.

All services are updated every hour with a new set of threat indicators prepared by Perun Works.
